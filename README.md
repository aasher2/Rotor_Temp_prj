# Welcome!

We created this repository in case another team is tasked to bring this project to completion. All necessary documents and many useful links are provided. 

The repository is split between paths for firmware and hardware. The firmware path just leads to the final code used for the BLE server and BLE client. The hardware path diverges into paths for the final design and for the proof of concept design. Most of the documents/datasheets/references will be found in the proof of concept folder.
